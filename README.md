# Test task /MusicApp/


## Short description

1. Counting of liked albums is carried out separately for each genre.
2. When you reload the page, the albums you like are displayed at the top of the list.
3. The number of downloaded albums from the server is limited to 15 (I think this is enough to test the program)

## I am looking forward to your feedback! Thanks
